templeos
========

This is the current iso of temple os. Will be updated on time and with own patches.

Currently all z files got converted via the tsz script.

For uncompressing files in GNU/Linux use `Linux/TSZ.CPP`.
There is currently no way to to compress files, name them to something without .Z and move them in TempleOS.

```
Move("Test.CPP","Test.CPP.Z");
```
